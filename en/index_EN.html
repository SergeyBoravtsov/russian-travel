                        According to polls by VCIOM, 95% of Russians dream of going somewhere, but only 36% plan to hold a business trip.
                        vacation in your home country. Like, what haven't we seen here at home? In fact, Russia is a whole country.
                        the universe with the gentle sea of the south, the dense forests of the Sayan Mountains and the harsh ice of the Putorana plateau. And also
                        you can see all these beauties without millions on the account, a foreign passport and many hours
                        flights. Like, for example, Vera Bashmakova-a brave young mother who took three in her arms
                        children, sat them in his "Lada" and drove 20 thousand kilometers across his native country. We chose
                        and described some interesting places worthy of your vacation.
